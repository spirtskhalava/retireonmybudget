        <p>
            My name is Ran Fridman.<p>
        <p>
            By nature, I love to help people. It is because I feel good when I'm helping someone. Years ago, I started <a href="https://www.cutsagainstcancer.org/" target="_blank">www.cutsagainstcancer.org</a>, and now I have begun another project to help others find happiness.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The Retire on my Budget project is created to help people retire happier, healthier, and smarter.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was born in Kyiv, Ukraine. However, I have lived worldwide for the past 30 years, including in the USA, Asia, and the Middle East.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm happily married to my lovely wife and have two beautiful daughters. In our family, we speak six languages and want to learn more. When we lived in different countries, I had opportunities to talk to people who retired in those countries.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I told them about my idea for this community project, Retire on my Budget, they said they wished there was something like this when they were planning their retirement.
        </p>
        <p>
            It would have saved them a lot of money, time, and stress and allowed them to find and learn from experts (both local and abroad) along with connecting them to businesses and like-minded people.
