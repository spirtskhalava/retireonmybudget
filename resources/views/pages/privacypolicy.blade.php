        <br/><b>What are Cookies?</b>
        <br/>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Your browser’s help file contains information and instructions for removing persistent cookies. Session ID cookies may be used by Retireonmybudget.com to track user preferences while the user is visiting the website. They also help to minimize load times and save on server processing. Persistent cookies may be used by Retireonmybudget.com to store whether, for example, you want your password remembered or not, and other information. Cookies used on the Retireonmybudget.com website do not contain personally identifiable information.
        <br/><b>Log Files</b>
        <br/>Like most standard websites, we use log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. However, none of the information stored in our log files, including but not limited to IP addresses, is linked to personally identifiable information.
        <br/><b>How we use this information</b>
        <br/>Retireonmybudget.com may use the personally identifiable information collected by Retireonmybudget.com to contact customers regarding products and services offered by Retireonmybudget.com and, to the extent the user has agreed to it, by its trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners. We may also use this information for research purposes regarding the effectiveness of our website services, marketing, advertising and sales efforts. Except as outlined below, Retireonmybudget.com will not in any way share this information with a third party unless you specifically authorize such disclosures.

        <br/><b>Special Offers and Updates</b>
